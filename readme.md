## Introduction

The app enables settling the debts in the group on the Trip. It calculates the depts so that the number of transfers is the tiniest. It was a team project intending to learn the basics of C++. The inspiration was the popular Splitwise app.

## General Info
You can choose whether to create a new Trip or open one from a file in the main menu. Next, you can see the options menu.

## Tests
To run tests, having built the project run in your command line:

`$./file_operations_tests.out`

`$./logic_tests.out`

* __The file operation tests__ consider handling files saved in a specific format. The trip file begins with the trip name, next a list of transactions, and ends with '&&&' symbols.

* __The logic tests__ consider logic and calculating the transactions.

## Improvements for the future

* Saving files in the csv or json format

* Graphic user interface

* Calculating different currencies
